## Installation
To use this project, clone the repository and compile the code:

# Usage
You can run the implemented algorithms and data structures in an Elixir interactive shell (IEx). For example, to use the Bubble Sort algorithm:
```elixir
iex -S mix
BubbleSort.sort([10, 3, 1, 6, 7, 11, 29])
```
